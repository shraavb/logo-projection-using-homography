# logo-projection-using-homography
Python implementation of homography estimation and inverse warping for projecting the Penn Engineering logo onto a football match video. Built for CIS 580 (Machine Perception), this project computes a 3×3 homography from point correspondences, warps image coordinates, and generates a perspective-correct logo projection across a video sequence.
